**Postmortem: Web Application Outage Due to Database Configuration Error**

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** The outage lasted for 2 hours and 15 minutes, from 10:30 AM to 12:45 PM UTC on August 15, 2024.
- **Impact:** Approximately 75% of users were affected, experiencing slow load times or complete inability to access the web application. The e-commerce service was down, leading to a potential loss of revenue and user trust.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the database connection pool led to an exhaustion of available connections, causing the application to become unresponsive under moderate traffic.

**Timeline:**

- **10:30 AM UTC:** The issue was first detected by a monitoring alert indicating a spike in response times and an increase in 500 HTTP errors.
- **10:35 AM UTC:** Engineers began investigating the web server, suspecting a load balancer misconfiguration.
- **10:45 AM UTC:** Logs were checked for any anomalies, but no significant errors were found on the web server side. 
- **11:00 AM UTC:** The database team was engaged as the issue persisted. Initial suspicion was on a possible DDoS attack, leading to a deep dive into firewall and network logs.
- **11:20 AM UTC:** Misleading path: The team spent time analyzing network traffic, assuming an external attack, but found no evidence to support this.
- **11:35 AM UTC:** Database performance metrics were checked, revealing a high number of connections in the “waiting” state.
- **11:45 AM UTC:** The root cause was identified as a misconfigured database connection pool, where the maximum connections were set too low, leading to saturation.
- **12:00 PM UTC:** The database connection pool configuration was adjusted to increase the maximum connections and optimize timeouts.
- **12:15 PM UTC:** The application was gradually restored, and monitoring showed a return to normal operations.
- **12:45 PM UTC:** The incident was declared resolved after verifying that all systems were stable.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured database connection pool. The configuration had the maximum number of allowed connections set too low (50 connections), which was not sufficient to handle the incoming traffic. Under normal circumstances, this would not have been an issue, but during a peak in user activity, the connections were quickly exhausted. As a result, the application could not establish new connections to the database, leading to timeouts and failures.

To resolve the issue, the database connection pool configuration was updated to allow a higher number of simultaneous connections (increased to 200). Additionally, the connection timeout was adjusted to ensure that connections would not linger unnecessarily, preventing the pool from becoming saturated.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements:**

- **Database Connection Pool Monitoring:** Implement better monitoring for database connection pool metrics, including alerting on connection saturation or high wait times.
- **Load Testing:** Perform more rigorous load testing to simulate peak traffic conditions and adjust configuration parameters accordingly.
- **Configuration Review:** Regularly review and audit configuration settings for critical infrastructure components.

**TODO List:**

1. **Patch Database Server:** Ensure that the database server is running the latest version and is optimized for performance.
2. **Add Monitoring Alerts:** Set up detailed alerts for connection pool metrics, including connection wait time and maximum connections used.
3. **Conduct Load Testing:** Schedule a load testing session to ensure that the new connection pool settings can handle peak traffic without issues.
4. **Review and Document Configuration:** Create documentation outlining the optimal database connection pool configuration for future reference and audits.
5. **Training:** Provide training for the engineering team on database connection management and troubleshooting to avoid similar issues in the future. 

This incident highlighted the importance of careful configuration management and the need for proactive monitoring to prevent outages that can impact user experience and business operations.
